Programming Methodology @ SFSU Fall 2013. 
==================================

This repo includes small programs developed in C++. Under each directory titled hw#TurnIn (# is the homework number 
e.g. hw1TurnIn) you can find a collection of small programs. Each program here is the way it was submitted for grading
and is structured as follow:
a) At the top of each program is a small description
b) The actual program, methods etc. 
c) Input. 
d) Expected output.

If you wish to execute these programs, you will have to make modifications so that it compiles successfully.

Note: For small programs I like using the Terminal on my Mac. For complex programs I use an IDE, NetBeans or Eclipse, for 
obvious reasons.
